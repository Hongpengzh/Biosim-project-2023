==================================

Introduction to BioSim
----------------------
BioSim is a project which simulates the ecosystem on
a small island called Rossum√∏ya. The simulation can
show the population dynamics on the island by figures
and movies, e.g.,
 .. image:: ./sample_00399.png
   :width: 400
   :alt: Simulation sample

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2
